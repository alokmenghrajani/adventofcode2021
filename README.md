# Advent Of Code 2021
[Advent Of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021) solution in [Go](https://golang.org/).

# Introduction
Advent of Code is an annual speed programming competition. Unlike several other
competitions, you only need to submit the solution for one specific input. As a
result, code which doesn't handle every edge case can sometimes still win!

My goal this year is just to have fun. Not trying to improve specific knowledge or get on the leaderboard.

This repo contains my solutions with little cleanup. I don't bother commenting my code. I do sometimes go back and
rename variables to improve clarity.

I hope looking at my code will help you learn a trick or two, just as looking at other people's solutions has helped
me.

# Previous years

1. I did fairly well in 2016 and 2017 using PHP, getting on the leaderboard almost each day.
2. In [2018](https://github.com/alokmenghrajani/adventofcode2018), I tried to solve each puzzle using a FPGA and forbidding myself from implementing a general purpose
   processor. I consider the endeavour a failure, achieving only 4 solutions.
3. I retroactively solved 2015, 2016, 2017 without any time pressure in [Rust](https://github.com/alokmenghrajani/adventofcode). I attempted to comment my code to the best of my ability.
4. I retroactively solved 2018 and 2019 using Go.
5. In [2020](https://github.com/alokmenghrajani/adventofcode2020), I used Go. The event seems to have become way more competitive than previous years -- I only got on the leaderboard twice.
